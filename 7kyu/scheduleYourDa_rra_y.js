// SCHEDULE YOUR DA(RRA)Y
// The best way to have a productive day is to plan out your work schedule. Given the following three inputs, please create an array of time alloted to work, broken up with time alloted with breaks:

// Input 1: Hours - Number of hours available to you to get your work done!
// Input 2: Tasks - How many tasks you have to do througout the day
// Input 3: Duration (minutes)- How long each of your tasks will take to complete

// Criteria to bear in mind:

//     Your schedule should start with work and end with work.
//     It should also be in minutes, rounded to the nearest whole minute.
//     If your work is going to take more time than you have, return "You're not sleeping tonight!"

// Example:

// dayPlan(8, 5, 30) == [ 30, 83, 30, 83, 30, 83, 30, 83, 30 ]
// dayPlan(3, 5, 60) == "You're not sleeping tonight!"

// MY SOLUTION
function dayPlan (hours, tasks, duration){
    if(tasks*duration > hours*60){
      return "You're not sleeping tonight!";
    };
    let breakIt = Math.round(((hours*60) - (tasks*duration))/(tasks - 1));
    return [...Array(tasks).fill(duration)].join(`*${breakIt}*`).split('*').map(x => Number(x));
}

// OTHER CLEVER SOLUTION
function dayPlan (hours, tasks, duration){
    var schedule = [];
    var timeToWork = hours * 60;
    var workChunk = tasks * duration;
    if ( workChunk > timeToWork) {
      schedule = "You\'re not sleeping tonight!"
    } else {
    var breakTime = (timeToWork-workChunk);
    var aBreak = Math.round(breakTime/(tasks-1));
    var nextUp = duration;
    for (var i = 1; i < tasks + tasks; i++){
      schedule.push(nextUp);
      if (i % 2 === 0){
        nextUp = duration;
      } else {
        nextUp = aBreak;
      }
    }
    }
    return schedule;
